These are internal wrangles to be called as part of a recipe.

They are not expected to be called directly by a user.

Many call the respective wrangles, but deal with the interactions with the dataframe used by the recipe.

Functions in main are called directly, other functions are called by their module name.

e.g.

wrangles:
  - classify:

  - convert.case:
