These are internal wrangles expected to be called as part of a pipeline.

Many call the respective wrangles, but deal with the interactions with the dataframe used by the pipeline.

Functions in main are called directly, other functions are called by their module name.

e.g.

wrangles:
  - classify:

  - convert.case:
